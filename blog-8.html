                                        In case the money owner wanted to defend against the seizing order, he has the
                                        right to raise a grievance against it before the competent court. The decision
                                        cannot be appealed if that appeal is dismissed. But the money owner has still
                                        had the right to raise the grievance after 3 months from the initial dismissal
                                        if he is not having any new circumstances to raise the grievance. By the event
                                        of new circumstances or reasons, he still may raise the grievance within 3
                                        months.
