                            <h4 class="mt-4"><u>What is a limitation period?</u></h4>
                            <p class="p mt-4">
                                A limitation period is the period of time within which a party must file a claim or
                                commence a legal action. If the claim is not brought within the period stipulated under
                                the relevant statute, there is a risk that that the claim will be considered
                                “time-barred”. If the claim is considered time-barred, this can result in the claim
                                being dismissed by the relevant court having jurisdiction over the matter.
                            </p>

                            <p class="p mt-4">
                                It is also important to determine when a limitation period will start to run. Limitation
                                period come in force in circumstances like: (i) a “cause of action” has occurred (for
                                example a breach of contract) or (ii) when a party becomes aware of the event or the
                                harm caused as a tort (for example personal injury).
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="mt-5"><u>Limitation periods under UAE Law</u></h4>
                            <p class="p mt-4">
                                In the UAE, limitation periods are not expressed in one comprehensive statute but are
                                contained in multiple statutes. Further, the length of the limitation period varies,
                                depending on the cause of action. The UAE Courts have also noted that that the
                                limitation period will be suspended if it appears from the surrounding facts and
                                circumstances of the case that there was an obstacle preventing the claim from being
                                commenced.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="mt-5"><u>Limitation period applicable for various types of claims:</u>
                            </h4>
                            <p class="p mt-4">

                                There are different time limits or limitation periods that apply to different types of
                                matters. For instance, the limitation period that applies to a contractual claim would
                                be different from an employment dispute claim.

                                    <p><u>General Contracts:</u> Generally, for contractual claims, the limitation
                                        period is
                                        set to run for fifteen years and lapses upon reaching this time period when
                                        there does not exist any valid legal excuse for the further extension in time
                                        (Article 473).

                                    <p><u>Commercial Contracts:</u> The limitation period is limited to ten years

                                    <p><u>Construction Contracts:</u> The period of limitation runs for ten years or

                                        and the contractor remain liable for defects that can endanger the solidity or
                                        security of the building (Article 880).

                                        for terminating a contract of sale of goods or reducing the price for the goods
                                        etc. the general norm of the limitation period shall run for one year from the
                                        date of the delivery of the goods (Article 524).

                                    <p>The limitation period shall run only from the day on which the debt has become
                                        due or from the day on which the claim conditions have been realized (Article
                                        478).</p>

                                        Further, the period of limitation is calculated in days, with the first day
                                        not being counted. The time limitation shall end on the last date of the
                                        prescribed limit; however, if the said date is an official holiday, then the
                                        time limit shall be extended to the following day (Article 480).
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        The limitation period can be interrupted in between whenever there exists a
                                        lawful excuse to gain such exemption and, thereby, the period for which such
                                        lawful excuse runs could be exempted from the overall time limit applicable
                                        under Article 481(1). Similarly, the limitation period also gets interrupted
                                        upon the institution of a court claim or any legal proceedings instituted by the
                                        creditor claiming his right (Article 484). The limitation period can be
                                        considered to have been interrupted when there is an express or tacit admission
                                        of the right by the debtor under Article 483. Moreover that, whenever the time
                                        period of limitation gets interrupted pursuant to Article 485
                                        (1), a new prescription period shall commence, which shall have the same
                                        duration as that of the former one.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p>It is also not permissible for parties to agree upon the term for limitation
                                        other than what has been fixed by the law (Article 487).</p>

                                The limitation period constitutes an irreplaceable role for the admissibility of a
                                claim. Still, the parties can make submissions explaining the delay on submission of a
                                claim when lawful excuses exist. In such circumstances, the court would decide the
                                justification of such lawful excuse, and the admissibility of the claim pursuant to the
                                rules governing limitation shall be subjected to the preliminary adjudication. It is
                                critical to gain a thorough understanding of the rules governing limitations in order to
                                avoid potential losses in the future
